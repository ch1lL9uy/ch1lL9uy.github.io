## Game 2 - Wait (misc)
**File**: [here](/assets/Kashi%20CTF%202025/Game%202%20-%20Wait.zip)     

this is godot game chall                                
So, I use `GDRE tools` to extract project from exe file

Then I opened the project in Godot and make a little edit in main

## Game 3 - CatSeabank
**File**: [here](/assets/Kashi%20CTF%202025/Game%203%20-%20CatSeabank.zip)

This is a Unity game challenge. As always, I used `Dnspy` to edit `Assembly-CSharp.dll` file and got a sound clip

**But There's no flag here**. So I used `AssetRipper` to extract resources                  
I found two sound clips, and one of them is named `flagfile`, with a duration of 5 seconds

After downloading the audio file, we got a file in Ogg format.

After searching for a while, I found a tool called `Audacity`                   
Open the audio file in Audacity using spectrogram mode

Just need a slight adjustment to see the flag more clearly
